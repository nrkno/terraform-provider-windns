# windns Provider

This Terraform provider allows you to manage your Windows DNS server resources through Terraform. Currently, it supports 
managing records of type `AAAA`, `A`, `CNAME`, `TXT` and `PTR`.

## Prerequisites

This provider requires a remote Windows server exposed with SSH and with the
[DnsService](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/dnsserver/?view=windowsserver2022-ps) 
PowerShell module installed. This server could be the DNS server itself.

## Why use this provider?
Other Terraform providers have implemented similar functionality, but they either require a local Windows installation
running PowerShell or utilize WinRM to execute PowerShell remotely. In many environments, this is not preferable or
possible.

The PowerShell module, which this and other providers rely on
[DnsService](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/dnsserver/?view=windowsserver2022-ps)
is using WinRM internally as the transport when talking to the DNS Server.

In an environment where the DNS server is running on a locked down Domain Controller with WinRM is disabled, one will thus 
run into problems with second hop WinRM. We have not been able to find a solution to making the second hop securely and easily.

This provider avoids the whole second hop problem by using SSH as the transport for the first hop when running PowerShell.
